Stacks Used - HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Gulp, SCSS, Node

##### Installation Steps
1. Please run `npm install` in the root directory. It will add all the dependencies included in package.json file.
2. Please check the gulpfile.js. The code for compiling scss files to css is added and the generated CSS file path is `src/assets/dist/custom.css`. Incase any scss changes has to be made, please run `npm run scss` to compile the newly added scss.
3. I recommend having Node version 12 or higher. I had node 11, and I ran into several dependency issues.
